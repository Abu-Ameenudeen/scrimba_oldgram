📸 Oldagram (Instagram-style Feed)

Oldagram is a front-end web project inspired by Instagram’s post feed. The project dynamically renders posts from JavaScript data, applies modern CSS layout techniques, and follows clean Git workflows using feature branches.

This project focuses on DOM manipulation, data-driven UI rendering, and clean UI styling, making it ideal for showcasing core front-end fundamentals.

🚀 Features

 - Dynamic rendering of posts from a JavaScript data array
  
 - Reusable post layout (no hard-coded HTML posts)
  
 - Profile header with avatar and location
  
 - Like, comment, and DM reaction icons with hover effects
  
 - Instagram-style post dividers
  
 - Clean typography using Google Fonts (Source Sans 3)
  
 - Responsive, centered feed layout


🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

JavaScript DOM manipulation

Looping through objects to generate UI

Template literals for dynamic HTML

Separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JS)

Flexbox layout and spacing (gap)

Hover and active UI states

Git feature-branch workflow (main + feature branch)


🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic structure

CSS3 – Flexbox, hover effects, layout styling

JavaScript (ES6) – dynamic rendering and logic

Git & GitHub – version control and branching


📌 How It Works

Post data is stored as an array of objects in index.js

JavaScript loops through the data

Each object is converted into HTML using template literals

Generated markup is injected into the DOM

CSS handles layout, spacing, and interactions
